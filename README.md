## Run

### What it needs
- Python 2.7 (Maybe it works in order versions of Python)
- PIL(AKA. Python Image Library)

### How to run it
1. Git-clone these codes.
2. Modify the file `config.ini`.
3. Create a directory named "history", or it might crush. The directory "history" is to storage the avatars generated by this program. 
4. Run it with a certain string as the first argument. If no strings are given, it will take current timestamp with two digits of dicimal fraction as its first argument.
4. If no arguments are given or only one argument is given, it will generate an avatar in (16 blocks x 16 blocks) with SHA256 hash. If two arguments are given (no matter what the second argument is), it will generate an avatar in (8 blocks x 8 blocks). 

## About this program
It is not perfect and lack of robustness in the first published version. 
I will continue improve the function and the experience of this program.
