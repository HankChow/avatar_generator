# Avatar-generator
This is a program for generating an avatar from a certain given string(regarded as seed). The default size of the avatars generated is 400x400, which is able to modify.

## Run

### What it needs
- Python 2.7 (Maybe it works in order versions of Python)
- PIL (AKA. Python Image Library)

### How to run it
1. Git-clone these codes.
2. Modify the file `config.ini`.
3. Create a directory named "history", or it might crush. The directory "history" is to storage the avatars generated by this program. 
4. Run it with a certain string as the first argument. If no strings are given, it will take current timestamp with two digits of dicimal fraction as its first argument.
4. If no arguments are given or only one argument is given, it will generate an avatar in (16 blocks x 16 blocks) with SHA256 hash. If two arguments are given (no matter what the second argument is), it will generate an avatar in (8 blocks x 8 blocks).
